# Egoism-in-Hip-Hop-Analysis
This script's primary function is to gather all public works from Hip Hop artists for the purpose of determining who is the most egotistical rapper. As hip hop is considered to be a very egotistical genre of music, especially with such a spokesman as Kayne West at the helm, I found it important to see if this was actually the case. 

This Python script uses the Genius API to extract lyrics from a large repository of lyrics (Genius.com) using their publically available API. This API, in conjunction with TextBlob to make the lyrics workable allowed me to crawl through enormous amounts of lyrics in one sitting. 

This project has room for improvement. While it does the primary goal, I believe I can improve how this script determines egoism in rap lyrics. For example, as the program stands, statements like "I am a humbler person" and "I am God" would have the same weighting of egoism, even though the latter statement is definitely more egoistic than the former. I intend to update this project as I grow as a programmer.
